// Your task is to use the forEach() array method to list all of the companies so that Doris can easily browse a list of her customers. Use the example code above as a starting point. The list of companies should look like the image below.

//  1. The variable name whose value is the list of customers is different
//  2. supplyObject is not an appropriate parameter name to store a single object representing a company.
//  3. The class names in the HTML string will be different.
//  4. The properties will also need to change. Purchasing company objects have very different property names (e.g. addressFullStreet)


import {listOfBuiltBusinesses} from './BusinessList.js'
